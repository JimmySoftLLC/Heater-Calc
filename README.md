# Heater-Calc
Web app that calculates heater transfer for conduction, convection, radiation, process load and heatup.

Heater Calc only uses html, css, js and bootstrap components. The bootstrap components that are used are cards, modals, navbar and footers. Because of this it is light weight and very fast.

It uses IndexedDB as a client database therefore there is no need for mongoDB to be running on the server.

This is a great example for those who do not want the maintenance of backend components like mongodb but need data persistence on the client side.
